PowerShell -Providers

	A Provider is also called a “snap-in” which is a dynamic link library (.dll) built into PowerShell. 
	A library is code that instructs PowerShell to preform an action when we execute a command. 
	What this means is that we no longer have to write code, as we did in VBScript, to connect to the registry. 
	The code is provided for us, simplifying our efforts.	

get-PSProvider

	alias, variable, certificate, registry,...

get-PSDrive

	a Provider enables access
	

functions-Provider

	A function allows you to make calls to a block of code
	if you notice that you are using the same code over and over (within the same script), you should consider creating a function

	viele set-location-functions --> c: = set-location c:\
	clear-host
	
Registry-Provider !!!
