Creating a .pem with the Private Key and Entire Trust Chain

Log into your DigiCert Management Console and download your Intermediate (DigiCertCA.crt) and Primary Certificates (your_domain_name.crt).
Open a text editor (such as wordpad) and paste the entire body of each certificate into one text file in the following order:

The Private Key - your_domain_name.key
The Primary Certificate - your_domain_name.crt
The Intermediate Certificate - DigiCertCA.crt
The Root Certificate - TrustedRoot.crt
Make sure to include the beginning and end tags on each certificate. The result should look like this:

-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
(Your Private Key: your_domain_name.key)
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
(Your Primary SSL certificate: your_domain_name.crt)
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
(Your Intermediate certificate: DigiCertCA.crt)
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
(Your Root certificate: TrustedRoot.crt)
-----END CERTIFICATE-----

Save the combined file as your_domain_name.pem. The .pem file is now ready to use.
