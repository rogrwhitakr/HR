Array
um RemoteComputer abzufragen

$Var = @(array of remote computers --> in "", if string)

$var.count

$var[0-inf.]

you can combine arrays --> $varX=@(1,2,3) + $varY=@(4,5,6)


Hash Tables
A Hash table is also known as a dictionary.It is an array that allows you to store data in a “key-value” pair association.

$var =@{var1=value;var2=value} --> apply "" as needed;


conditional Logic

The if statement syntax:

	if (condition) {code block}
	elseif (condition) {code block}
	else (condition) {code block}
	
	condition = an expression that results to a Boolean Value (True or False).
	code block = what to execute if condition is True.
	elseif (optional) = test an alternative condition if preceding condition was False.
	else (optional) = executes it's code block whenever none of the if or elseif statements return a True result.
	
hier her und nicht weiter!!!

once an if statement condition results in a True value the associated script block is executed, 
PowerShell stops testing subsequent conditions. The way around this is to use a switch statement.
